        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Every project in this collection is crafted with deliberate attention
          to clean design, responsiveness, and performance. From initial concept
          through to deployment, I transform ideas into visually compelling,
          fully functional web experiences powered by React and Tailwind CSS.
          This portfolio spans a range of work: landing pages, reusable UI
          component libraries, and responsive layouts built to scale. Each
          project represents a milestone in my growth as a frontend developer
          and reflects my ongoing transition into fullstack development building
          not just great interfaces, but complete, end-to-end solutions.
