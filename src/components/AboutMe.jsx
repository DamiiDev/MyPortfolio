            <h3>MYSELF</h3>
            <p>
              I'm Damilare Festus, a Frontend Developer passionate about
              building clean, fast, and user-friendly web experiences. I
              specialize in React.js, and Tailwind CSS, crafting scalable
              components and responsive layouts that look great on any device.
              Currently expanding into full-stack development to deliver
              complete, end-to-end solutions. Let's build something great
              together.

            <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
            <p>
              I hold a B.Eng in Computer Engineering from Ekiti State
              University, graduating with a Second Class Upper (2:1). My
              academic foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms,
              and software engineering shapes how I approach every project with
              clarity, structure, and efficiency. I also completed the NYSC
              program, where I sharpened my adaptability and problem-solving
              skills in real-world environments.
